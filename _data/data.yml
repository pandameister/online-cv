  experiences:
    - role: Lead Front End Developer
      time: 2014 - Present
      company: Salesforce.com, San Francisco
      details:
        I've worked and led various front end projects in Salesforce's Analytics and Platform divisions. In the Platform division, I'm currently leading the front end development of the next generation of Salesforce's Flow Builder product.  My team is building a modern process flow designer UI using Salesforce's new LWC UI framework and typescript, leveraging SVG and animations to create an exceptional user experience.
        <p>
        In the Analytics division, I helped integrate and productize an analytics startup Salesforce acquired in 2014. This involved migrating their legacy jquery/backbone + coffeescript based UI to React.js + ES6 and building out a large SPA that would scale and be maintainable.  Later I worked as a lead developer and architect of Salesforce's new data visualization framework called Wave Charts (an alternative to D3), and was instrumental in making it a highly performant, scalable and extensible data visualization platform that has been adopted across the company, and is used by millions of users every day.
        </p>

    - role: Senior Full Stack Developer
      time: 2009 - 2014
      company: Salesforce.com, San Francisco
      details: I joined Salesforce as a full stack developer working in their Content Management and Chatter (social & news feed) divisions. This involved writing code for Salesforce's core application server in Java, as well as authoring complex SQL and PL/SQL. I delivered many critical features such as news feed attachments, document previews (queued rendering), content sharing permissions management, file management REST APIs, etc.

    - role: Software Developer
      time: 2000 - 2009
      company: Trigo Technologies + IBM, Burlingame + San Francisco
      details: Trigo was a small Master Data Management startup that was eventually acquired by IBM. I worked there as full stack developer mostly writing Java and Oracle SQL, but also implementing DHTML and home grown AJAX features in 2002 using iframes long before SPAs where a thing. I stayed on at IBM after the acquisition working on their MDM product offering, and later their Mashup Hub project, doing front end work in javascript + dojo.
