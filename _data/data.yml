    experiences:
        - role: Lead Front End Developer
          time: 2014 - Present
          company: Salesforce.com, San Francisco
          details: I've worked and led various front end projects in Salesforce's analytics division, helping integrate and productize an analytics startup they acquired in 2014. This involved migrating their legacy jquery/backbone + coffeescript based UI to React.js + ES6 and building out a large front end application that would scale and be maintainable.  More recently I've been a lead developer of Salesforce new data visualization framework called Wave Charts (an alternative to D3),  and have been instrumental to make it a successful highly performant, scalable and extensible data visualization platform used across the company.

        - role: Senior Full Stack Developer
          time: 2009 - 2014
          company: Salesforce.com, San Francisco
          details: I joined Salesforce as a full stack developer working in their Content Management and later Chatter (social & news feed) divisions. This involved writing code for Salesforces core application server in Java, as well as authoring some complex SQL and PL/SQL. I delivered many critical features such as news feed attachments, document previews (rendering), content sharing & access, file management REST APIs, etc ... that are used every day by hundreds of thousands of users.

        - role: Software Developer
          time: 2000 - 2009
          company: Trigo Technologies + IBM, Burlingame + San Francisco
          details: Trigo was a small Master Data Management startup that was eventually acquired by IBM. I worked there as full stack developer mostly writing Java and Oracle SQL, but also implementing home grown AJAX features in 2002 using iframes long before SPAs where a thing. I stayed on at IBM after the acquisition working on the MDM offering, and later their Mashup Hub project doing front end work in javascript + dojo.
